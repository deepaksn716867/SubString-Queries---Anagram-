Input Format:

The first line of input file contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases to follow.
Each of the test cases contain the string S in first line. The next line contains an integer Q. Each of the next Q lines contain a query string qstr.

Output Format:

The output file should contain answers for each query in a new line.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 3
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
1 ≤ Q ≤ 200
None of the characters in qstr shall be repeated.
All the strings will only contain characters from A-Z, a-z and 0-9.

Notes:

    The substrings are considered different only if there start or end positions differ.
    Subsequence is a sequence of characters that you obtain upon deletion of 1 or more character from the string.

Sample Explanation:

a 0..0
ab 0..1
aba 0..2
ba 1..2
a 2..2

(the start and end points here, are inclusive)
